## About the Game
Monster Moto Rush is a high-octane 2D motorcycle racing game developed to promote Monster Energy Drink’s brand identity and presence in the e-gaming community. Players race across adrenaline-fueled tracks filled with rugged terrain and neon-lit visuals, performing daring stunts and chaining combos to boost their scores against the clock.

The game delivers an immersive, fast-paced experience that captures the bold, extreme lifestyle Monster Energy is known for, blending skillful racing with stylish visuals and brand synergy.
## Project Background
As part of a second-year design module, my group chose Monster Energy Drink as our brand due to its strong connection with the gaming and e-sports communities. We conducted brand research to extract insights that shaped the game’s design, ensuring alignment with Monster’s ethos of energy, thrill, and performance.

Our goal was to create an advergame that’s both engaging and clearly tied to the brand’s identity, encouraging player interaction and brand recall through gameplay.
## My Role and Contributions
- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Developed a system to generate varied, scalable terrains dynamically, allowing the creation of multiple unique tracks with varying complexity. This approach simplifies level design and future scalability.
- **Shader Graph**: Learned and applied Unity’s Shader Graph to create animated fullscreen shaders for the dynamic backgrounds of each level, enhancing visual appeal and atmosphere.
- **In-Game Store System**: Designed and implemented an in-game store where players can purchase and equip bike skins, adding personalisation and progression mechanics.
- **Data Persistence**: Implemented data saving and loading to ensure player progress, purchases, and equipped skins persist between game sessions, enhancing user experience.
- **UI & UX Design**: Collaborated on designing intuitive user interfaces and smooth user experience flows that complement the fast-paced gameplay.

The most challenging aspect was building the store system due to its complexity and the need to integrate multiple components seamlessly.
## Tools and Technologies
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Programming**: C# scripting
- **Visual Effects**: Unity Shader Graph
- **Design**: Photoshop
## What I Learned
- How to implement procedural terrain generation systems that balance randomness with gameplay design needs.
- Practical use of Unity Shader Graph to create dynamic, engaging visual effects.
- Designing and coding a complex in-game store with multiple interconnected components, including purchase, equip, and data persistence.
- Best practices for saving and loading player data to create seamless game experiences.
- Collaborating within a team to integrate coding and UI/UX design effectively.
## Future Improvements
- Expand the store with more customisation options and special effects to increase player engagement.
- Enhance procedural terrain algorithms to generate even more varied and challenging tracks.
- Implement more advanced stunt and combo systems for deeper gameplay complexity.
- Integrate multiplayer modes to foster competitive play aligned with Monster Energy’s esports sponsorships.
